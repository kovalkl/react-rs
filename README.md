## Project Overview

Star Wars Characters Catalog is a web application that allows users to explore a catalog of characters from the Star Wars universe. The application is built using modern web technologies to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used to create the interactive components of the application.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, providing enhanced code quality and development experience.
- **Vite**: A fast and modern build tool that offers a lean development experience.
- **React Router**: A library for managing and navigating routes in the application.
- **Redux**: A state management library that helps manage the application state in a predictable way.
- **Next.js**: A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter to maintain code style consistency.
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and fixing linting issues in the codebase.
- **Husky**: A tool for managing Git hooks, ensuring code quality checks are run before commits.

## API

The application uses the following API to fetch data about Star Wars characters:

- **Star Wars API (SWAPI)**: A public API that provides information about characters, films, starships, vehicles, species, and planets from the Star Wars universe. The data fetched from this API is used to populate the character catalog in the application.
